# 🚀 Tutorials
This repository contains step-by-step tutorials for developers who want to quickly learn and experiment with kdb+ and its libraries.

The repository is organized into three main sections:
- kdb+: Focused on using kdb+ and the q programming language for various use cases such as time-series analysis, event processing, and more.
- pykx: Focused on helping python developers quickly understand and experience the power of PyKX and its interactions with kdb+/q.
- ai-libs: Focused on integrating kdb+ with AI/ML workflows, including working with embeddings, indexing, and querying.

## 📥 Getting Started

To get started, **clone this repository** to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KxSystems/tutorials.git
cd tutorials
```
Make sure you have kdb+ installed and accessible, along with Python (for the PyKX tutorials).

**Note:** The ai-libs tutorials require a beta version of software. They will not work with standard kdb+.
