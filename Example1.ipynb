    "Welcome to this example where we'll demonstrate how to work with large datasets in kdb+ to analyze time-series data. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of kdb+ is its ability to handle huge volumes of data with exceptional speed and efficiency. Whether it's reading massive datasets, performing time-based aggregations, or joining data from different sources, kdb+ excels at time-series analysis. By the end of this example, you'll have a clear understanding of how to create, manipulate, store, and analyze data using kdb+/q. Along the way, we'll introduce several key concepts that are fundamental to working with kdb+/q.\n",

    "Here, we'll cover:\n",
    "- Creating a large time-series dataset from scratch\n",
    "- Saving this data to a database on disk\n",
    "- Scaling database to 1 Billion rows\n",
    "- Performing time-based aggregations to analyze trends over time\n",
    "- Using asof joins (aj) to combine time-series data (e.g., matching trades to quotes)"

    "SQL is more complex due to several factors:\n",
    "- **Time-series Calculations**: The SQL version involves the creation of custom logic for common time-series calculations such as volume-weighted-averages. In the q-sql version, these functionalities are implicit, and the syntax is more concise when working with vectors. The SQL equivalent requires custom definitions and is often more verbose leaving room for error.\n",
    "- **Grouping and Aggregation**: In the q-sql version, grouping by date and a 15 minute window is done with a single, simple syntax, which is an efficient and intuitive way to express time bucketing. In SQL, similar behavior requires explicitly defining how time intervals are handled and aggregating the results using GROUP BY with custom time expressions which are often repeated throughout the query.\n",
    "- **Temporal Formatting**: SQL queries often require repetitive conversion for handling timestamp formats, which is more cumbersome compared to q-sql, where time-based operations like xbar (interval-based bucketing) can be done directly in a streamlined manner. Temporal primitives also make it extremely easy to convert a nanosecond timestamp to it's equivalent minute using dot notation e.g. time.minute\n",
    "- **Data Transformation**: The q language is optimized for high-performance, in-memory, columnar data transformations, which allows for more compact expressions on vectors of data. SQL, on the other hand, is typically too general purpose for even simple transformations on time-series data. This is down to how kdb+/q is designed, where operations execute on ordered lists, whereas SQL (based on set theory) treats data as records instead of columns e.g. selecting the (last) value in a series, or understanding prior states (deltas) for series movements would require re-ordering the column data\n",
    "- **Performance Considerations**: q-sql is designed for high-performance analytics on large datasets, and many operations that would require complex SQL expressions can be done efficiently with q-sql syntax. In SQL, complex operations requires workarounds such as additional processing with temporary tables, sub-expressions, re-indexing, changing data models, or heavily leveraging partitions and window functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, while the core logic of the query is similar in both languages, the SQL version requires much more overhead in terms of complexity and verbosity. This inefficiency will also become more pronounced with large datasets, leading to challenges with query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these are just basic analytics, they highlight kdb+/q’s ability to storage and analyse large-scale time-series datasets quickly."

    "## 6. Asof Join – Matching Trades with Quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features in kdb+/q is the asof join (`aj`), which is designed to match records from two tables based on the most recent timestamp. Unlike a standard SQL join, where records must match exactly on a key, an asof join finds the most recent match.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use Asof Joins?\n",
    "In time-series data, we often deal with information arriving at different intervals. For example:\n",
    "- Trade and Quote Data: A trade occurs at a given time, and we want to match it with the latest available quote.\n",
